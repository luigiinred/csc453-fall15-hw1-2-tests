A simple HTML document


Some stuff < this is not a tag> 
Bold stuff
Italicized stuff
Bold and italicized
Also bold and italicized, but with improperly nested tags.
This arrow is not part of a comment, and should be visible: -->

<!-- This is not a tag according to our definitions
because it spans multiple lines (i.e., contains '\n' characters,
     which are considered not printable)>



XXX YYY ZZZ
  -->

& > < "

<this string contains a control character  and therefore is not a tag>

<	this sequence begins with a tab>
<this sequence contains a tab (here: 	)>


<a partial tag -- since it doesn't contain the right angle bracket this is not a tag and so should be visible
